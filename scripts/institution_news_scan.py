"""
institution_news_scan.py — Daily scan of Netherlands institutions' own news
pages for research-information-system and procurement announcements.

WHY THIS EXISTS, separately from scripts/news-scan.js:

news-scan.js queries Google News RSS, which indexes news outlets. It cannot
see an announcement that only ever appeared on a university's own site.

That is not hypothetical. On 13 April 2026 Radboud University announced that
its ten-year CRIS contract had been awarded to Vidatum — a direct Elsevier
Pure competitor — as a staff news item on ru.nl. No award notice was ever
filed to TED or TenderNed (TenderNed's record still reads isGegund: false),
and Google News has zero results for it. Verified 2026-09-12: searches for
"Radboud CRIS Vidatum", "Radboud University Vidatum" and "Vidatum CRIS" all
return nothing. The tender scraper could not catch it because no notice
exists; news-scan.js could not catch it because no outlet covered it.

This scanner reads the institutions' own feeds and news pages directly, which
is the only channel that carried it.

Sources are RSS/Atom where the institution publishes one, and plain HTML
headline extraction where it does not. Keyword matching is deliberately
narrow — see is_signal() — because an HTML news page also yields navigation
links, and only a real announcement clears the bar.
