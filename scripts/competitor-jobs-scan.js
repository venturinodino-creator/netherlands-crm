/**
 * competitor-jobs-scan.js — Daily scan of open roles at companies that sell
 * a product directly competing with one of Elsevier's named RI solutions
 * (Scopus, SciVal, Pure, Insight Graph, 4GU reports, Digital Commons),
 * scoped to a Netherlands account manager's specific interest: go-to-market
 * and customer-facing hiring tied to that competing product line — Strategic/
 * Senior Account Management (SAM), Channel/Partnerships, and the full
 * customer-lifecycle line (Customer Success, pre-sales/solution consulting,
 * implementation/onboarding, technical/product support, customer service &
 * licence admin, training & customer education, usage/reporting analytics,
 * product marketing) — not engineering, core product/eng management,
 * editorial, finance, HR, or an unrelated business line like a diversified
 * competitor's IP/patent or clinical-regulatory arm. See classifyRole()
 * below for the exact title patterns per category.
 *
 * Only 3 of the companies tracked elsewhere in this app (e.g. in
 * news-scan.js's Competitor Announcements) actually qualify — see SOURCES
 * below for the product-competitor mapping (Clarivate/Web of Science vs
 * Scopus, etc). Companies that are broadly "an Elsevier competitor" but
 * don't sell a Scopus/SciVal/Pure/Digital Commons-type product (OpenAI,
 * Anthropic, Elicit, SciSpace, Springer Nature, Wiley) are deliberately
 * excluded here even though they have a working ATS — see
 * NOT_PRODUCT_COMPETITOR below.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT LinkedIn: LinkedIn requires login for job search and
 * actively blocks automated access, so there is no reliable or
 * ToS-compliant way to scrape it from a script (and no free public API —
 * LinkedIn's Jobs/Talent API is enterprise/partnership-only). Instead this
 * pulls straight from each company's own careers-page ATS, whose public
 * JSON API is meant for exactly this kind of programmatic read — and since
 * a LinkedIn job post is near-always just a syndicated copy of the ATS
 * listing, this captures the same signal without the ToS problem.
 *
 * Per-company ATS coverage (verified by hand — see git history for the
 * research this was built from; do not guess new endpoints without
 * verifying the same way):
 *   - Greenhouse, Ashby, SmartRecruiters, Pinpoint: simple GET, no auth.
 *   - Workday (CXS API): requires a POST with a JSON search body — see
 *     fetchWorkday() below.
 *   - No usable public API found: scite (not hiring), Consensus (LinkedIn
 *     only), Paperguide (no formal ATS), IGI Global (email-only), IEEE
 *     (Taleo, session-based), Google (proprietary/internal API). These are
 *     listed in UNTRACKED_COMPANIES so the UI can be upfront about the gap
 *     instead of silently omitting them.
 *
 * Unlike news-scan.js, this does a full resync each run rather than an
 * accumulating feed: a role no longer returned by a company's ATS has
 * presumably closed, so it's dropped from the live list. foundDate is
 * preserved across runs for a role that's still open, so "open since" is
 * still visible.
 *
 * salary/applicationDeadline are best-effort text extraction (see
 * extractSalary/extractDeadline) from whatever description text is
 * available for a role that already passed the location/role filters —
 * most postings don't have a hard application deadline at all (rolling/
 * open-until-filled is the norm), and salary disclosure depends on the
 * company and jurisdiction, so both are frequently null. That's an honest
 * "not stated," not a bug.
 *
 * No ANTHROPIC_API_KEY needed — ATS results are already precise structured
 * data, no relevance judgement call required, just deterministic
 * location/title filtering.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/competitor-jobs-scan.js
