/**
 * competitor-jobs-scan.js — Daily scan of open roles, based in the
 * Netherlands or remote, at Elsevier's tracked competitors, scoped to a
 * Netherlands account manager's specific interest: go-to-market and
 * customer-facing hiring — Strategic/Senior Account Management (SAM), Sales
 * Development (SDR/BDR), Channel/Partnerships, and the full customer-
 * lifecycle line (Customer Success, pre-sales/solution consulting,
 * implementation/onboarding, technical/product support, customer service &
 * licence admin, training & customer education, usage/reporting analytics,
 * product marketing) — not engineering, core product/eng management,
 * editorial, finance, HR, or an unrelated business line like a diversified
 * competitor's IP/patent or clinical-regulatory arm. See classifyRole()
 * below for the exact title patterns per category.
 *
 * Covers every company tracked elsewhere in this app as an Elsevier
 * competitor (e.g. in news-scan.js's Competitor Announcements) that also has
 * a usable public ATS API — see SOURCES below for the full list and what
 * each one competes with. The tracked competitors with no public feed at
 * all (LinkedIn-only postings, static pages, session-based ATS, Google's
 * internal API) are covered by a Claude web search — see WEB_SEARCH_SOURCES.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT LinkedIn: LinkedIn requires login for job search and
 * actively blocks automated access, so there is no reliable or
 * ToS-compliant way to scrape it from a script (and no free public API —
 * LinkedIn's Jobs/Talent API is enterprise/partnership-only). Instead this
 * pulls straight from each company's own careers-page ATS, whose public
 * JSON API is meant for exactly this kind of programmatic read — and since
 * a LinkedIn job post is near-always just a syndicated copy of the ATS
 * listing, this captures the same signal without the ToS problem.
 *
 * Per-company ATS coverage (verified by hand — see git history for the
 * research this was built from; do not guess new endpoints without
 * verifying the same way):
 *   - Greenhouse, Ashby, SmartRecruiters, Pinpoint: simple GET, no auth.
 *   - Workday (CXS API): requires a POST with a JSON search body — see
 *     fetchWorkday() below.
 *   - No public feed at all: scite, Consensus, SciSpace, Paperguide, IGI
 *     Global, IEEE (session-based Taleo), Google (internal API) — re-checked
 *     2026-09-18. Each of these gets one Claude web search per run instead
 *     (see WEB_SEARCH_SOURCES / fetchWebSearch): the model is asked for the
 *     open roles in the tracked categories based here or remote, and every
 *     URL it returns is fetched before the role is listed.
 *
 * Like news-scan.js, this now accumulates rather than fully resyncing: a
 * role no longer returned by a company's ATS is marked closed (status:
 * 'closed', closedDate set) but stays visible in the live list for
 * ARCHIVE_AGE_DAYS — only after a role has been closed for a full month
 * does it move out to ARCHIVE_FILE. This was a deliberate fix: the old
 * full-resync-every-run behavior dropped a role from the UI the instant a
 * company's ATS stopped listing it (even a same-day repost gap), which
 * both under-counted real opportunities and gave an account manager no
 * chance to still see/reference a role they'd already started on. A role
 * that reappears in the ATS after being marked closed is un-closed
 * (status back to 'open', closedDate cleared) rather than treated as new.
 * foundDate/lastSeenDate are preserved across runs for a role that's still
 * open, so "open since"/"last confirmed" stay visible.
 *
 * salary/applicationDeadline are best-effort text extraction (see
 * extractSalary/extractDeadline) from whatever description text is
 * available for a role that already passed the location/role filters —
 * most postings don't have a hard application deadline at all (rolling/
 * open-until-filled is the norm), and salary disclosure depends on the
 * company and jurisdiction, so both are frequently null. That's an honest
 * "not stated," not a bug.
 *
 * ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is needed only for the web-searched companies above; the
 * ATS sources are deterministic location/title filtering and run without it
 * (the web-searched companies are then reported as untracked).
 *
 * Run: node scripts/competitor-jobs-scan.js
